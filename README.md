This is a repository made for Local Hack Day Hackathon -Build
We are working on the track of healthcare.
We are making an APP for the following problem:
these days as we can see that there is a lot  traffic in cities  and less transportation in remote areas  and due to that we loose a large amount of precious souls everyday,
as some of the ambulances got stuck up in the traffic and can't reach to hospitals timely, 
SO ,we have come up with the solution to deal with  this problem by making an app known as "108SAVER" .
In this app we will be using the GPS tracker technology so that we can  track the ambulance and ambulance can get the shortest and safest route to the destination whether it is the Patient's home or the Hospital.
if by any chance our ambulance get stuck in traffic or any other problem occurs the respective driver will report on the app that he is not able to reach timely.
Other drivers who are with backup ambulances will get the location and reach there within minutes and will pick the casuality and take it to hospital
